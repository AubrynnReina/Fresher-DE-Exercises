    "- Imbalanced workload: some partitions may have significantly more data than others, lead to some tasks taking much longer to complete, which can slow down the entire job.\n",
    "- Out of memory errors: skewed data can cause out of memory errors, can be particularly problematic if the data is being cached in memory for iterative processing.\n",
    "- Uneven resource usage: a partition may consume a disproportionate amount of resources (such as CPU or memory), leading to inefficient resource utilization.\n",
    "- Slow processing times: Skewed data can cause slower processing times, particularly for operations like joins and aggregations, which require shuffling and data movement between partitions.\n",
    "- Job failures: skewed partitions cause out-of-memory errors or lead to long-running tasks that exceed the maximum allotted time."
